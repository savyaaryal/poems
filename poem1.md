I’m busy;

but not in the way

most people accept.

I’m busy calming my fear

and finding my courage.

I’m busy listening to others.


I’m busy getting in touch

with what is real.

I’m busy growing things and

connecting with the natural world.

I’m busy questioning my answers.

I’m busy being present in my life❤️
